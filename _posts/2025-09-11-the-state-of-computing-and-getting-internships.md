title: The State of Computing & Getting Internships
---

With internship and full time recruiting seasons in full swing, I've been seeing a lot of people giving out, what is in my opinion, misguied advice. From what I've seen, most of these people fall into one of two camps. Either they've been in the industry for so long that they're out of touch with the challenges facing current students and new grads. Or, they had one particular circumstance (whether they realize it or not) that has enabled them to achieve some level of success and now they treat everything they did along the way as the "right" formula for success. 

That said, I think every piece of advice should be taken with a grain of salt, mine included.

### The State of Computing

First off, I think it would be a disservice to talk about how to get internships or jobs without talking about the state of computing as a whole. The market is more competitive now than ever before; caused by a perfect storm of oversaturation, AI hype (whether that's justified or not is to be seen), and the lingering effects of past overhiring. 

A few years ago, tech jobs were painted as the dream: six figure salaries, flexible hours, and a low barrier to entry. Some people were landing [$100k+ job offers after a three month bootcamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331/). Naturally, everyone flocked, and that's clearly evident today. When I talk to people around campus, nearly everyone is majoring in computer science, data science, or some other related major.

However, many of the shiny perks that once drew people in are fading fast. Companies are rolling out return to office mandates, 50-60 hour work weeks are becoming the norm, layoffs seem to make headlines almost every week, and the barrier to entry has climbed higher than ever. 

The only thing that’s really stayed the same is the salary; and for those with the talent and work ethic, that alone makes tech one of the best fields to pursue. But setting yourself up for success while you’re still in college isn’t just important; it’s mandatory if you want to find a job. I personally know multiple people who graduated years ago and are still unemployed or underemployed. If you don't believe me, just look at the [unemployment statistics](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/computer-science-dream-become-nightmare-185942789.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHG0adOACjDc4yP2jsU3dNrXeCljs6OoXiHxJHFxyy4MsOK9zdJMKK2fVOCcC5fJ-EvQW_MviFI95aoWQ24iyLl2uLfMpWMYU59FBLH_mb0iMbxEd7HU5SK2nliBtbBbqx_e_0y977A9NcxcjaTHiRv2fvqmsqHj3OI32eRBdl5c).

Now, this might all sound discouraging, but in my opinion there's a relatively straightforward blueprint to set yourself up for success. 

### Getting Internships

The single most important goal throughout college should be landing an internship (multiple ideally). They give you real world experience that classes can’t replicate, and they’re the most reliable path to a full time offer. Furthermore, the interview bar for interns is drastically lower than it is for new grads.

<b>Freshman Year</b>

Your first year, the main focus should be two things: building a strong understanding of fundamentals through introductory programming classes, and finding ways to gain experience on campus. 

There are a ton of opportunities on campus: teaching assistantships, research labs, technical consulting clubs, and project teams. These usually have a really low barrier to entry, but they'll teach you a lot about working in a team, etc. Additionally, they'll give you relevant experiences that you can put on your resume, which you can then leverage when applying to internships. 

Landing an internship after freshman year is difficult, but not impossible. Your best bet is to apply to targeted first year programs like UberStar, Meta University, Amazon Future Engineer (AFE), and Google Step. Even if you don't land one, the experience you gain from applying and interviewing will be invaluable during future recruitment cycles.

During the summer, if you ended up getting an internship, great. Otherwise, try gaining additional experience, maybe TA for summer classes or join a professor's lab. Also, work on a personal project or two to bolster your resume.

<b>Sophomore Year</b>

By the start of your sophomore year, you should already have one or two experiences on your resume, along with two or three projects. Try to gain another experience to round out your resume. From here, you should be in a good spot.

You should be aiming to secure an internship somewhere. It doesn’t have to be FAANG+ right away, but ideally you land one at a recognizable, “name-brand” (Fortune 500) company. The bigger the company, the easier your junior recruiting cycle will be.

If you don't up getting an internship, it's not quite time to hit the panic button. Double down on building experience through other avenues or creating personal projects. Make sure you're in a strong position heading into junior year.

<b>Junior Year</b>

By your junior year, all the groundwork should be laid. You should already have the necessary experiences and projects on your resume, and now it's time to hit the applications even harder. This is the single most important recruiting cycle of your college career, the company you intern at will very likely be the company you end up working for full time. 

If summer rolls around and you don't have an internship, definitely hit the panic button. At this point, you need to figure out what you're doing wrong and fix it fast.

<b>Senior Year</b>

Ideally, senior year should be relatively chill. By this point, you’ll have had a strong internship and, hopefully, a return offer lined up. If that’s the case, you can shift your focus to finishing out your degree, building passion projects, and living life.

If you don’t have a return offer though, you’ll need to hit the new grad recruiting cycle hard. Apply widely, use every connection you’ve built, and treat the process with the same urgency you had during your junior year.

<b>Applying</b>

When it comes to applying, apply everywhere, apply often, and apply early. Make sure to keep track of your applications and leverage referrals from peers, family friends, relatives, etc.
