title: The State of Computing & Getting Internships
---

- i've been seeing a lot of people giving, in my opinion, misguided advice
- i think people are either out of touch, or products of survivorship bias, they've had one circumstance or another that has enabled them to achieve some level of success, and they use this as justification that everything theyve done along the way must be right
- take every piece of advice with a grain of salt, including my own

- competitiveness of the market, perfect storm of oversaturation, AI, and overhiring
- however, for those who are willing to put in the work, CS is still the best field

- firstly, the 20 hours a week remote jobs making 200k a year, are virtually wiped out
- now, that same pay for entry level jobs require 50-60 hours a week, and are incredibly competitive

- if you graduate without an internship, you are probably screwed, there's a backlog of 3-4 new grad classes where people can't find jobs that you'll have to compete with

- don't prioritize graduating early unless you have a great internship and return offer secured 

- your freshman year should be about taking your classes and getting experience on campus
- - this can include TAing, joining clubs, project teams, consulting clubs if your school has those, etc.
- - firstly, these experiences will teach you a lot: working in a team, etc etc
- - low barrier to entry experiences that you can add to your resume, which you can then leverage
- getting an internship after your freshman year is extremely hard, but doable; i'd recommend applying to targeted first year programs such as UberStar, Meta University, Amazon Future Engineer (AFE), etc. etc.
- - even if you don't secure one, the applying/interview experience you may gain will be invaluable

- during your sophomore year, you should be able to get an internship if you have the previous experiences on your resume,
