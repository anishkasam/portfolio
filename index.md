## About

I'm majoring in data science, with a minor in math. My broad interests include probability, statistics, and computer vision.

I'm currently a data science intern at [Qualcomm Institute](https://qi.ucsd.edu/) where I'm working on various projects applying machine learning to medicine, advised by [Dr. Ganz Chockalingam](https://pdel.ucsd.edu/people/research-affiliates/ganz-chockalingam.html). I have also served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses within the [Halicioglu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), mostly under [Marina Langlois](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/marina-langlois/). 

This past summer, I worked at Amazon as a software development engineer intern on the Alexa Communications device software team.

In my free time I chase my hoop dreams, conduct freelance probability & statistics research (sports betting), watch documentaries, and try making different recipes.
